# Image Type

Image formats are separated with two major types, **Bitmap/Raster** format or **Vector** format. With each format comes with different compression method and provides different functionalities.

## Choose an image from the drop down menu

After you picked which image to display, it will show the image with each image type. The image type that are not supported will display as it's not supported. It will also display the file size and the comparison of it's file size ranking from the smallest to the largest.

> > Due to different conversion method, some file types may be able to be reduced further without degrading the quality, and it might cause the ranking of the file sizes to be skew in one way or another.
