# Responsive Design

We have all seen a website that looks nice on a desktop but it looks out of place on a mobile device. This is because the website isn't designed with all the users in mind.

In this demo we will showcase the result of using `@media` to create a responsive deisgn that works on all devicess.

the `@media` rule can take in a _media types_ which will be either `all`, `print`, or `screen` and a _media features_ with the most uses being `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height`. We will touch on the other _media features_ in later lectures and explain them more thoroughly.

If you expand the demo panel and start adjusting the size of it, you can see that as you expand the size, the page become more like a desktop view with the contents layed out horizontally. And as you strink the view down, the contents starts to stack on top of each other which can represent more of a mobile view.
