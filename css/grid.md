# Grid

- two dimensional context
- some important terminologies
  - **grid container**
    - the parent element that host the grid
  - **grid item**
    - each individual element that are within the grid
  - **grid line**
    - each line that are drawn(usually not shown) between each element
  - **grid cell**
    - the whole unit of the element, which also include the extra spacing within that element
  - **grid track**
    - each row and column within a grid
  - **grid area**
    - equal number of row and column that are adjacent to each other, starting with 2x2 and move upward
  - `fr`
    - allows for setting the size of a track as a fraction of the free space
    - this is calculated after all non-flexible items

## Grid Container

- `display`
  - **syntax**
    - `grid | inline-grid`
- `grid-template-columns` & `grid-template-rows`
  - defines a template for columns and rows
  - **syntax**
    - `<track-size> | [<line-name>]`
    - `<track-size>`
  - `<track-size>`
    - size of each row/column
    - can be any unit
  - `<line-name>`
    - the lines between each row/column
    - can be any name
    - can take multiple arguments
- `grid-template-area`
  - defines a template for the area
  - each name in the grid defines a cell
  - **syntax:**
    - `"<grid-area-name> | ."`
    - `none`
  - `<grid-area-name>`
    - the name that is specified
  - `.`
    - an empty grid cell
  - `none`
    - no grid area defined
  - each rows much have the same numbers of cells
- `grid-template`
  - short hand to define `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-template-areas`
  - **syntax:**
    - `<grid-template-areas> | <grid-template-rows> / <grid-template-columns>`
    - `<grid-template-areas> <grid-template-rows> / <grid-template-columns>`
  - if `<grid-template-areas>` is not defined it will default to `none`
- `column-gap`, `row-gap`
  - defines the size of the grid lines
  - **syntax:**
    - `<line-size>`
  - can be any unit values
  - can't specify the outer edge of the grid
- `gap`
  - short hand for `column-gap` and `row-gap`
  - **syntax:**
    - `<row-gap> | <column-gap>`
- `justify-items`
  - aligns grid items along the row axis
  - **values:**
    - `stretch`
      - fills the whole width of the cell
    - `start`
      - align items to the start edge of their cell
    - `end`
      - align items to the end edge of their cell
    - `center`
      - align items to the center of their cell
- `align-items`
  - aligns grid items along the column axis
  - **values:**
    - `stretch`
      - fills the whole height of the cell
    - `start`
      - aligns items to the start edge of their cell
    - `end`
      - align items to the end edge of their cell
    - `center`
      - align items to the center of their cell
    - `baseline`
      - align items along text baseline
- `place-items`
  - short hand for `align-items` and `justify-items`
  - **syntax:**
    - `<align-items> <justify-items>`
  - if one of the value is omitted, then it will set both to the same value
- `justify-content`
  - aligns the whole grid along the row axis
  - this is useful when the total grid size is smaller than the grid container
  - **values:**
    - `start`
      - aligns the grid to the start edge of the grid container
    - `end`
      - aligns the grid to the end edge of the grid container
    - `center`
      - align the grid to the center of the grid container
    - `stretch`
      - fill the full width of the grid container
    - `space-around`
      - places an even amount of space between each grid items, with only half of the space on outside of the grid
    - `space-between`
      - places an even amount of space between each grid items, with no space on the outside of the grid
    - `space-evenly`
      - places an even amount of space between each grid items, including the outside of the grid
- `align-content`
  - aligns the whole grid along the column axis
  - this is useful when the total grid size is smaller than the grid container
  - `start`
    - aligns the grid to the start edge of the grid container
  - `end`
    - aligns the grid to the end edge of the grid container
  - `center`
    - align the grid to the center of the grid container
  - `stretch`
    - fill the full width of the grid container
  - `space-around`
    - places an even amount of space between each grid items, with only half of the space on outside of the grid
  - `space-between`
    - places an even amount of space between each grid items, with no space on the outside of the grid
  - `space-evenly`
    - places an even amount of space between each grid items, including the outside of the grid
- `place-content`
  - short hand for `align-content` and `justify-content`
  - **syntax:**
    - `<align-content> <justify-content>`
  - if one of the value is omitted, then it will set both to the same value
- `grid-auto-columns` & `grid-auto-rows`
  - specifies the size of any grid tracks that are created when grid items are placed outside of the grid
- `grid-auto-flow`
  - specifies which way the grid will be filled up if the grid items aren't being specified their cell
  - **syntax:**
    - `row | column | row dense | column dense`
  - `dense` keyword tells the algorithm to place smaller contents in first
- `grid`
  - short hand for `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-areas`, `grid-auto-rows`, `grid-auto-columns`, and `grid-auto-flow`
  - **values:**
    - `none`
    - `<grid-template>`
    - `<grid-template-rows> / [ auto-flow && dense? ] <grid-auto-columns>?`
      - this will set the `auto-flow` to `column`
    - `[ auto-flow && dense? ] <grid-auto-rows>? / <grid-template-columns>`
      - this will set the `auto-flow` to `row`

## Grid Items

- `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`
  - determines the grid item's location based on which grid line is being called
  - **values:**
    - `<number>`
      - the grid line number
    - `<name>`
      - the grid line name
    - `span <number>`
      - the item will span across for however much number specified
    - `span <name>`
      - the item will span across until it hits the line name spcified
    - `auto`

  - **syntax**
    - `<start-line> / <end-line>`
- `grid-area`
  - can refer to the area name specified in `grid-template-area`
  - or a short hand for `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`
- `justify-self`
  - aligns grid item inside a cell along the row axis
  - **values:**
    - `start`
      - align the grid item to the start edge of the cell
    - `end`
      - align the grid item to the end edge of the cell
    - `center`
      - align the grid item to the center edge of the cell
    - `stretch`
      - stretch the grid item out to fill the cell
- `align-self`
  - aligns grid item inside a cell along the column axis
  - **values:**
    - `start`
      - align the grid item to the start edge of the cell
    - `end`
      - align the grid item to the end edge of the cell
    - `center`
      - align the grid item to the center edge of the cell
    - `stretch`
      - stretch the grid item out to fill the cell
- `place-self`
  - short hand for `justify-self`, `align-self`
  - **syntax:**
    - `<align-self> <justify-self>`
  - if one of the value is omitted, then it will set both to the same value

## Special Units & Functions

### fr units

- meaning the portion of the remaining space
- `1fr 1fr` = 2 50%

### sizing keywords

- any units can be used
- `min-content`
  - the minimum size of the content
- `max-content`
  - the maximum size of the content
- `auto`
  - kind of like `fr` but it can't compete with it
- `fit-content`
  - use the space available, but never less than `min-content` and never more than `max-content`

### sizing functions

- `minmax(100px, 1fr)` is setting the `min()` and `max()` of the declaration

### repeat() function

- `repeat(4, 1fr)` is the same as `1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr`
- can be combined with `auto-fill` and `auto-fit` or `minmax()`
- one of the best one to use is `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))`
