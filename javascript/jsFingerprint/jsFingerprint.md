# JS FingerPrint

## How to use the demo

Make sure to keep both jsFingerprint-client.js and jsFingerprint-server.js in the same folder

Run the server code in npm then launch the client code in a browser

Switch between incognito mode, turn on VPN or hosting the project in the cloud service like Heroku. You will observe that the visit count will increase untill the server code is turned off, in which case it will reset

Changing the browser will offset the results since using different browsers will have different Fingerprint identification ID
